# mongodb

This is my MongoDB workshop using Chef to create a cookbook. 

In the interest of differentiating my workshop from the provided example, I ran my cookbook through FoodCritic and corrected everything FoodCritic found. 

I could not get Test Kitchen to work with Vagrant. Some investigation on Google leads me to believe I have to update my PATH for Vagrant. I might try that later. 

In the catagory of "embarassing lessons learned," I found out Chef will not recognize a cookbook unless the cookbook is in a "Cookbooks" folder. 

I used a Debian Vagrant box.
